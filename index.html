        <h1>Playfair Display</h1>
        <p>
            Playfair is a transitional design. In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day. With developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became fashionable to print letter forms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letter forms. This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it takes influence from the designs of John Baskerville and Scotch Roman designs.

            <p>Coffee, in its many forms, is a ritual cherished by cultures worldwide. The theme of coffee grounds speaks to the very foundation of this beloved beverage — those tiny, fragrant granules that hold the essence of a perfect cup. Each ground, whether coarse or fine, contains the history of its origin, the climate it was grown in, and the careful attention paid by farmers. Ground coffee is not just an ingredient but a sensory experience that awakens the mind and energizes the body. It holds the promise of something rich and invigorating, waiting to be brewed into a moment of warmth and comfort.</p>
       <p>The beauty of coffee lies in its diversity, from the robust, rich, and smooth texture of a strong brew to the delicate balance of sweetness and acidity in a lighter roast. A sip of well-prepared coffee is like savoring layers of flavor, each unfolding differently depending on how it is prepared. A rich blend can coat the palate like velvet, offering a full-bodied experience, while a smooth cup provides comfort—no bitterness, only balance. The richness of coffee reflects life's complexity, where the smoothness is the simplicity we crave amidst the chaos.</p>
       <p>Espresso, the purest expression of coffee, is often seen as the pinnacle of this craft. Made by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans at high pressure, it delivers a shot of concentrated flavor. Espresso is intense, quick, and bold, with a crema on top that hints at its depth. It's the heartbeat of many coffee-based beverages, from lattes to cappuccinos, yet it stands alone as a powerful statement of what coffee can be at its most potent. Espresso demands respect and attention—a brief moment where all distractions fall away, and all that exists is the cup in front of you.</p>
       <p>Whether one prefers light, medium, medium-dark, or dark roast, coffee is a personal journey of discovery. Lighter roasts bring out the beans' natural acidity and fruity notes, perfect for those who enjoy a brighter cup. Medium roasts strike a balance between smoothness and complexity, offering just the right amount of richness. Medium-dark and dark roasts are for those who crave deeper, bolder flavors, often with hints of chocolate or smoke. Each roast represents a different aspect of coffee’s personality, from vibrant to mellow to intense, reflecting the broad spectrum of what coffee can be for each individual. </p>
